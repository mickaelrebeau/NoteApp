## Technologies Used

NoteApp utilizes a combination of frontend and backend technologies to provide its functionality.

### Frontend Technologies

- TailwindCSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-built UI components and utilities to help build responsive and modern user interfaces.

- Shadcn-ui: A popular component library to help you build user interface.

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of the application.

- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. TypeScript helps catch errors early during development and improves code maintainability.

- Vite: A fast build tool for modern web applications. Vite provides a zero-config development server and optimized production builds, making the development process more efficient.

### Backend Technologies

- NestJs: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. NestJs follows the modular architecture pattern and provides a set of powerful features for building APIs and microservices.

- TypeScript: TypeScript is also used on the backend to take advantage of its static typing and code organization features.

- TypeORM: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript that simplifies database access and management. TypeORM supports various database systems, including PostgreSQL.

### Database

- PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database management system. PostgreSQL is known for its reliability, scalability, and extensibility, making it a popular choice for web applications.

By using these technologies, NoteApp is able to provide a responsive and modern user interface, efficient backend services, and seamless integration with the database.
